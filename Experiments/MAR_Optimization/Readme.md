# Memory Address Register (MAR) Optimization Study

## Motivation

While studying *Computer Organization and Design* by Patterson & Hennessy, I encountered **Amdahl's Law**, which states that the overall performance improvement obtained from an optimization depends on the fraction of execution time affected by that optimization.

This prompted the following question:

> **Can the Memory Address Register (MAR) be removed from my multi-cycle processor without affecting correctness, and if so, how much performance improvement does it provide?**

The completed 8-bit processor serves as an experimental platform to quantitatively evaluate this architectural modification.

## Background

In the original processor, memory instructions require an additional T-state to load the Memory Address Register before accessing RAM.

Original memory access sequence:

```
Fetch
 ↓
MAR ← IR[7:0]
 ↓
RAM Access
```

Since memory operands are encoded directly within the instruction, the MAR may be unnecessary. The proposed optimization directly connects the instruction operand (`IR[7:0]`) to the RAM address bus.

Optimized memory access sequence:

```
Fetch
 ↓
RAM Access ← IR[7:0]
```

This removes one T-state from every memory-related instruction.

## Hypothesis

Removing the Memory Address Register should:

- Reduce the CPI of memory-related instructions.
- Improve execution time for memory-intensive workloads.
- Produce little improvement for programs containing relatively few memory operations.

According to **Amdahl's Law**, workloads spending more execution time performing memory accesses should experience greater overall speedup.

## Methodology

The following modifications will be implemented:

- Remove the Memory Address Register.
- Directly connect `IR[7:0]` to the RAM address input.
- Update the Control Unit to remove the MAR load state.
- Verify functional correctness using existing Cocotb verification infrastructure.
- Re-run logic synthesis and static timing analysis.

## Benchmarks

The optimized processor will be evaluated using existing software benchmarks.

| Benchmark | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Maximum of Two Numbers | Minimal memory activity |
| Unsigned Multiplication | Moderate memory activity |
| 2×2 Matrix Multiplication | Memory-intensive workload |

For each benchmark the following metrics will be collected:

- Total clock cycles
- CPI
- Execution time
- Measured speedup

## Expected Observation

The **Maximum** benchmark is expected to exhibit minimal performance improvement because relatively few instructions perform memory accesses.

The **Multiplication** benchmark should show moderate improvement due to repeated memory loads and stores.

The **Matrix Multiplication** benchmark is expected to demonstrate the greatest speedup since memory accesses dominate program execution.

These observations should illustrate the practical implications of **Amdahl's Law**, showing that architectural optimizations provide benefits proportional to the fraction of execution time affected by the optimization.

## Results

*To be completed after implementation.*

| Benchmark | Original Cycles | Optimized Cycles | Speedup |
|-----------|----------------:|-----------------:|--------:|
| Maximum | | | |
| Multiplication | | | |
| Matrix Multiplication | | | |

## Discussion

*To be completed after implementation.*

Discussion will include:

- Comparison between predicted and measured speedup.
- Effect of memory intensity on overall performance.
- Architectural trade-offs introduced by removing the MAR.
- Whether the optimization justifies the additional hardware simplification.

## Conclusion

*To be completed after implementation.*
